# Bosnia
*A repository filled with imaginary data of what I hope to have with my Bosnia research one day.* 

## Purpose of Repo
This repository centers around a (hopefully not forever) fictitious mixed methods research study about how the narrative of war affects inter-ethnic relations in post-conflict Bosnia.

## Data Types
- Qualitative: interviews - focus groups, representing each of three main ethnicities.
- Quantitative: field observations - levels of inter-ethnic engagement at key centers across BiH.
- Demographics of participants

## Repo Contents
- Central Quarto file
- Data files (.csv)
- Raw files of interview transcripts
- Coded files of those transcripts (imported from MAXQDA)
